Simulate the amplitude and phase variation of an oscillator excited by thermal noise as a function of steady-state phase.

Random fluctuations are applied to the in-phase (real) and out-of-phase (imag) components of the resonator amplitude and the resulting magnitude and phase are calculated.

The imaginary component does no work on the resonator but modifies its frequency. Amplitude-frequency pull (e.g. mechanical nonlinearity) is neglected for simplicity.
